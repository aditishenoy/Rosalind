# Rosalind

Rosalind is a Bioinformatics problem solving platform. It contains a variety of problems for individuals just getting started with computational biology and programming. I have created this repository to document and structure my way of thinking for the problems I have solved for the Bioinformatics Textbook Track and Bioinformatics StrongHold problem set. 

You can find more information about Rosalind and their repository of problems here - http://rosalind.info/problems/list-view/
