# Rosalind

Rosalind is a Bioinformatics problem solving platform. It contains a variety of problems for inidividuals just getting started with computational biology and programming. I have created this repository to document and structure my way of thinking for the problems I have solved for the Bioinformatics Textbook Track and Bioinformatics StrongHold problem set.
